## Movie Recommender System
A movie recommendation system is a software tool that provides movie recommendations to users. This repository contains a movie recommender system that makes use of a dataset of movies and user ratings to suggest movies to a user.

The repository includes the following files:

<b>movies.csv</b>: This file contains information about movies, such as the movie title, genre, and director.

<b>ratings.csv</b>: This file contains user ratings for movies. Each row represents a rating by a user for a movie.

<b>mrs.py</b>: This is the main file that contains the code for the movie recommender system. The code uses the pandas and numpy libraries to process the data, and implements a simple collaborative filtering algorithm to generate recommendations.

<b>Running the Movie Recommender System</b><br>
To run the movie recommender system, you will need to have the following software installed:<br>
<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
Python 3<br>
pandas and numpy libraries<br>
Once you have the required software installed, simply open the mrs.py file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code. You can then enter the title of a movie that you like, and the system will generate a list of recommended movies for you.<br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
This repository provides a basic implementation of a movie recommender system. The code can be used as a starting point for building a more advanced recommendation system. The implementation uses a simple collaborative filtering algorithm and could be improved by incorporating other techniques such as content-based filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning.

<b>Note</b>: file similarity.pkl is more than 100 mb, hence was unable to upload it on github however, it can be seen in "Movie Recommender System Project.ipynb"
