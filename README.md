## Movie Recommender System
A movie recommendation system is a software tool that provides movie recommendations to users. This repository contains a movie recommender system that makes use of a dataset of movies and user ratings to suggest movies to a user.

The repository includes the following files:

movies.csv: This file contains information about movies, such as the movie title, genre, and director.

ratings.csv: This file contains user ratings for movies. Each row represents a rating by a user for a movie.

movie_recommender.ipynb: This is the main file that contains the code for the movie recommender system. The code uses the pandas and numpy libraries to process the data, and implements a simple collaborative filtering algorithm to generate recommendations.

Running the Movie Recommender System
To run the movie recommender system, you will need to have the following software installed:

Jupyter Notebook
Python 3
pandas and numpy libraries
Once you have the required software installed, simply open the movie_recommender.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells. You can then enter the title of a movie that you like, and the system will generate a list of recommended movies for you.

Conclusion
This repository provides a basic implementation of a movie recommender system. The code can be used as a starting point for building a more advanced recommendation system. The implementation uses a simple collaborative filtering algorithm and could be improved by incorporating other techniques such as content-based filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning.

file similarity.pkl is more than 100 mb, hence was unable to upload it on github however, it can be seen in "Movie Recommender System Project.ipynb"
